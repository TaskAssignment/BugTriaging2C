# BugTriaging2
This project includes the experiments for bug assignment (using Github and Bugzilla data sets).

The bug assignment is based on expertise scores of the developers. The scores are obtained by comparing their and the bug reports' expertise graph against each other. We use Jaccard based matching scores combined with IR techniques to find the similarity between two graphs (i.e., a bug and a developer).
